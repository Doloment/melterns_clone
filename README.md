# Melterns
An in-development mod for [Minetest](http://minetest.net) 0.5.0+ that adds molten metals, melting, casting and creating tools. This mod is inspired by the [Tinkers Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) mod for Minecraft, however it's much less-featured due to the current limitations of the Minetest API. None of the components used in this mod have been taken from TC - everything is my original creation.

## Component mods
